variable
	Data type
	variable name
	value
	declaration ( mandatory before using )
	initialization - assign a value to a declared variable for the first time
	Use a variable only if it has a value.
		printing
		assigning
	equal sign rules... assignment operator
		RHS of equal sign should match the data type
		LHS of equal sign should always be a variable
		If RHS is another variable.. then value of that varible gets assigned
			to the LHS varible
		If RHS is another variable.. RHS & LHS data type should match
		
		int a = 20; // a=20
		a=10; // a=10
		int b = 30; // b is 30
		b=40; // b is 40
		b=a; // a is 10.. value of RHS var a .. is reassig to b
		System.out.println(a);
		System.out.println(b);
		
		
		int c=10; 
		int d=10;
		boolean e=true;
		d=c; // NO errors
		d=e; // errors
		
		
		Primitve variable - can have literal values
		Object variables - can have reference value (new <class_name>)
			String can have both
